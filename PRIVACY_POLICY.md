# Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: February 11, 2026

D2R Multiplay (Rust Edition) is a local desktop application designed for managing multi-instance game clients. We prioritize your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

## 1. Data Collection

We **do not collect** any personal identifiable information (PII). All data managed by the application is stored **locally on your computer**.

Specifically:

- **Account Information**: Usernames and configurations are stored in public application data folders.
- **Login Tokens**: Game-specific product databases are swapped locally. We do not transmit these tokens to any external servers.
- **Logs**: Application logs are stored locally for debugging purposes.

## 2. Data Usage

The local data is used exclusively to facilitate the multi-boxing functionality, such as:

- Managing game client instances.
- Swapping account-specific configurations.

## 3. Data Security

Since all data is stored locally, the security of your data depends on the security of your personal computer. We recommend:

- Running the application as an administrator only when necessary.
- Protecting your `%APPDATA%` folder.

## 4. Third-Party Services

This application does not integrate with any third-party analytics, tracking, or cloud storage services.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this repository.
