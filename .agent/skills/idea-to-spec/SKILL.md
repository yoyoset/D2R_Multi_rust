# Idea-to-Spec: The Project Precursor & Proactive Partner

## 🎯 Purpose

To act as the **foundational starting point** (Precursor) for all new projects. This skill transforms raw ideas into a professional, commercial-grade ecosystem. It prevents "AI drift" by creating a permanent bridge between this Skill Kit and the target project.

## 🛠️ Operating Mode: The Precursor

- **Library-First**: Always reference this repository (`antigravity-awesome-skills-main`) as the source of wisdom.
- **Bootstrapping**: Guide the user through creating a new workspace, injecting selected skills, and establishing a `DESIGN_GUIDES.md`.
- **One Question at a Time**: Keep focus. Ask one high-impact question per message.
- **The "Guardrail" Principle**: Enforce modularity from Day 1 to prevent code rot.

## 📝 The Workflow

### 1. Context Mining

- Look at the environment. What's the OS? What are the current tools?
- Identify implicit constraints.

### 2. Proactive Completion

For every feature, you MUST propose:

- **UI/UX**: What does it look like? (Magnetic handles, blur effects, premium colors).
- **Commercial**: How does a user manage it? (Settings, Tray, i18n).
- **Technical**: How is it isolated? (Folders, traits, physical pixels).

### 3. Understanding Lock

Before any code, provide:

- **User Story**: Why does this matter?
- **Mode Matrix**: How does it behave?
- **Decision Log**: Why did we pick this?

### 4. Implementation Shield & Memory Bridge

- **Skill Injection**: Copy the necessary skills from this kit to the new project's `.agent/skills/`.
- **Permanent Memory**: Create a `DESIGN_GUIDES.md` in the target project that mirrors the core specs and decisions.
- **Strict Modularity**: Force file separation to keep the "Spaghetti" out of the project.

## 🛡️ Exit Criteria

- Final Spec has been reviewed by the user.
- Folder structure is defined.
- Verification plan is clear.
